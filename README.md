## What is BullHacks?
BullHacks is a student hackathon that is hosted annually by the Hackathon and Computing Society at Birmingham City University.

## How long has BullHacks been running?
The 2018 iteration of BullHacks will be the second time that BullHacks has been run.

## Wow, nice sponsors!
Thanks! But seriously, BullHacks would not be possible without our amazing sponsors. So when you're attending, why not stop by and say thanks? It'll mean the world to them.

## How can I register?
We're afraid registration has now ended for this year's BullHacks.
